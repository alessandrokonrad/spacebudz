              <p>Liability for Contents</p>
              <p style={{ fontSize: 13 }}>
                The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care. For
                the correctness, completeness and timeliness of the content, we
                can not guarantee. As a service provider, we are responsible for
                our own content on these pages under the general laws according
                to § 7 para.1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not
                obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored
                foreign information or to investigate circumstances that
                indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
                use of information according to the general laws remain
                unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible
                from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the
                law becomes known. If we become aware of corresponding
                infringements, we will remove this content immediately.
              </p>
              <p>Attitude for Links</p>
              <p style={{ fontSize: 13 }}>
                Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties,
                on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot
                assume any liability for these external contents. The respective
                provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the
                content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
                possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal
                contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However,
                a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not
                reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law.
                If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such
                links immediately.
              </p>
